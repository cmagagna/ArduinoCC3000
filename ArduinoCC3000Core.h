/*
	The timing between setting the CS pin and reading the IRQ pin is very
	tight on the CC3000, and sometimes the default Arduino digitalRead()
	and digitalWrite() functions are just too slow. 
	
	For many of the CC3000 library functions this isn't a big deal because the
	IRQ pin is tied to an interrupt routine but some of them of them disable
	the interrupt routine and read the pins directly. Because digitalRead()
	/ Write() are so slow once in a while the Arduino will be in the middle of
	its pin code and the CC3000 will flip another pin's state and it will be
	missed, and everything locks up.
	
	The upshot of all of this is we need to read & write the pin states
	directly, which is very fast compared to the built in Arduino functions.
	
	The Teensy 3.0's library has built in macros called digitalReadFast()
	& digitalWriteFast() that compile down to direct port manipulations but
	are still readable, so use those if possible.
	
	There's a digitalReadFast() / digitalWriteFast() library for Arduino but
	it looks like it hasn't been updated since 2010 so I think it's best to
	just use the direct port manipulations.

/* If you uncomment the line below the library will leave out a lot of the

   http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tiny_Driver_Support
   
  CC3000's new driver has flexible memory compile options.
  
  This feature comes in handy when we want to use a limited RAM size MCU.
  
  Using The Tiny Driver Compilation option will create a tiny version of our
  host driver with lower data, stack and code consumption.
  
  By enabling this feature, host driver's RAM consumption can be reduced to
  minimum of 251 bytes.
  
  The Tiny host driver version will limit the host driver API to the most
  essential ones.
  
  Code size depends on actual APIs used.
  
  RAM size depends on the largest packet sent and received.
  
  CC3000 can now be used with ultra low cost MCUs, consuming 251 byte of RAM
  and 2K to 6K byte of code size, depending on the API usage. */
